# Database

Course: CEN326 - Software Project Development

Project 2 : My Simple Binary File Database

You will develop a simple database using binary files. A user will input/define a desired table with desired columns/fields and a primary key. You may consider only one field or a combination of fields as a primary. Then you will create the first binary file that defines the metadata of (information about) the table, the second binary file that stores records of the table, and the third binary index file that stores index information of the records being stored in the second binary file based on the primary key. When a table is created, users will be asked to perform below operations:

a.	Create/Insert a record

b.	Read/Search a record based on a given primary key without using binary index file

c.	Read/Search a record based on a given primary key with using binary index file

d.	Update a record based on given primary key without using binary index file

e.	Update a record based on given primary key with using binary index file

f.	Delete a record based on given primary key without using binary index file

g.	Delete a record based on given primary key with using binary index file

h.	Perform several CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations based on random keys

i.	Order all records of a table according to given primary key without using binary index file

j.	Order all records of a table according to given primary key with using binary index file

•	You are not allowed to read/write the whole object into a file

•	The files must be as minimum as possible
